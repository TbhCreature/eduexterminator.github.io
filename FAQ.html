<b><h3>What are those little ovals under the typing section?</h3>
<b>These: </b><button data-v-7afdcb15="" disabled="disabled" content="Login" type="submit" class="drop-shadow" tabindex="0"><i data-v-7afdcb15="" class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></button><b> Are essential for the botting process. They fetch what the input for the typing box is.</b></b><div id="forest-ext-shadow-host"></div><b><br><h3>Does this break the rules?</h3>
<b>No, this does not break rules, this complies by the GitHub and GitHub Pages Terms of Service (rules). This is also done in a way that does not break the Terms of Service or rules of the online education platforms. Obviously, this also does not break laws. <br><br></b><b>We are NOT saying that this doesn't break your school's rules, or what your parents make the home rules if you are homeschooled. We are not responsible in if you get in trouble with your parents or school.</b></b>
