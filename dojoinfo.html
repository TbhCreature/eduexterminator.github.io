<br><h2 style="color:white;">What is ClassDojo?</h2>
<p style="color:white;">ClassDojo is an online behavioral education site. Teachers will put their students into the site. Each student will have an avatar and they have points. Everytime you do something good, a teacher adds a point. If you misbehave, they subtract one point. -1000 to +1000 points.</p></center>
<br>
<center><h2 style="color:white;">Why are we making this tool?</h2><p style="color:white;">We think that this people doing this is completely unacceptable. Teachers shouldn't be able to control students like this. The class could be talking, but as soon as they hear the "-1 point" sound they shut up, this is stupid, so we have made this tool so students get their way and so teachers aren't able to control students, also to ruin the ClassDojo.</p></center>
<br>
<center><h2 style="color:white;">What are we adding to this tool? (when it comes out)</h2><p style="color:white;">•A way to add and remove points from your classmates and yourself, •A "Ban every student in this Dojo" button •A "Permenately deactivate this Dojo" button that bans every student from the Dojo and gets rid of the class so the teacher(s) can't add students •A "Crash students' and the teacher's device (temporary)" button, there may be more when this gets implemented.</p></center>
