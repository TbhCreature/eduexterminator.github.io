<p>Basically, we hide most of the code we use in our tools. Even if you go to Inspect Element or view the page source, <i>almost</i> all of it is hidden. However, we will explain part of how this works. Sometimes, we use the API of the websites. Example: api.i-ready.com. However, most of the tools we use don't use this strategy because the API usually restrics the tools we use, so... Sometimes, we create fake accounts when you select an option. For example, if you use our i-Ready tool, it'll create bot student accounts designed to complete that lesson, fetch the answers, the lesson ID, etc. To create a student account without needing a CAPTCHA, we must use different IP addresses. We will not be publicly stating which software we use to get these IP addresses, however nobody uses these IPs until we claim them.</p></body></html>
