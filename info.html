<center><h2>No more working on Kahoot!, Khan Academy and WordWall!</h2><p style="color:white;">Our site has gotten A LOT of attention in the last few weeks! Because of this, we have developed a bot that stops you from having to work on <a href="kahoot.html">Kahoot!</a>, <a href="khan.html">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="wordwall.html">WordWall!</a></p>
<br><br><br><p style="color:white;">No PC? No problem! We've noticed that many schools actually use paper work instead of online work. We have developed a solution; Exterminator Max: With this tool you can A: Scan paperwork and get answers or B: Get the name of the paper work and look it up on Exterminator Search! It gives you the answers to paperwork by getting the name and/or the ID of the work to get the answers. This includes final exams! You can use keywords such as: 9th grade, Math, Final Exam, FSA, 2022, (website the work is hosted on (if you know it), etc. </p></center>
